This works because in a BST if both values are less than the root then we go left, if both values are bigger than the root then we go right. If one value is smaller and one value is bigger then the root is the lowest common ancestor

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        while root:
            if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
                root = root.right
            elif p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
                root = root.left
            else:
                return root
